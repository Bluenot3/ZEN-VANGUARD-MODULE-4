  summaryForAI:
    "Module 4 of ZEN AI VANGUARD, 'AI Systems Mastery & Professional Integration,' elevates learners to operational experts. Section 1 focuses on systems engineering, covering system mapping, prompt control flows, agent framework comparisons (smolagents, LangGraph), advanced memory design (RAG), data pipelines (ETL), and MLOps principles like testing, observability, security, and human-in-the-loop governance. Section 2 transitions to strategic oversight, teaching data analytics and storytelling, anomaly/drift detection, cost optimization, ethical and bias audits, and legal/IP considerations. The module culminates in assembling a comprehensive Governance Pack, undergoing a crisis simulation, and credentialing their skills on-chain, preparing them for leadership roles in the AI-driven economy.",
